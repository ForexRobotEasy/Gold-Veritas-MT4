## Trading Style and Risk Tolerance

The Expert Advisor allows users to set their preferred trading style and risk tolerance. The variables `tradingStyle` and `riskTolerance` are used to store these values.

## Expert Advisor Start Function

The `start()` function is the entry point for the Expert Advisor. It first checks if it is quiet trading hours by calling the `IsQuietTradingHours()` function. If it is, it proceeds to execute the appropriate trading strategy based on the trading style set by the user.

## Check if it is Quiet Trading Hours Function

The `IsQuietTradingHours()` function is responsible for determining if it is quiet trading hours. The logic to determine this is not provided in the code and should be implemented separately. The function should return `true` if it is quiet trading hours and `false` otherwise.

## Execute Trading Strategy Functions

There are four separate functions for executing trading strategies for each currency pair. These functions are called based on the trading style set by the user in the `start()` function.

### TradeXAUUSD()
